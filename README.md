# React-Context-Reducer-Global-State
Global State using React Context and Reducer


Please notice this is just an example of how this is done, including a main app component, reusable components, and the context and reducer set up.

This is not a selt sustaining react app, as it does not include many needed dependencies. 

To input it into your app, create your own react app and then add this entire folder to your src folder and import Todo_App into your desired react component.
